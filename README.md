This notebook aims to carry out an exploratory data analysis of producer food prices in Malaysia using the [dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/8147f617-b323-40ea-a03f-5c21db2c62bb/resource/69b1b7b8-701a-44bf-816b-6a07b78fbc77) provided by The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX). It contains data about the Malaysian producer food prices recorded over almost three decades. Apache Spark (through the PySpark interface) was used to carry out the required data-wrangling while Seaborn was used to create the visualizations.
